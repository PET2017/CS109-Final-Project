# CS109-Final-Project

NOTE: You may have to press "Reload" a couple of times when you try to open the Final Project Notebook. Github seems to be a little finicky in loading the notebook because of its size. It has loaded the notebook (after one or two reloads) every time we tried. 

This folder contains all of our data files used in the project as well as our process notebook. We did not install any special Python packages in order to run our code (beyond the setup we had for CS109) so you should be able to run the notebook without any trouble. In case the github version of our notebook doesn't work for some reason (the slideshows might not render, for instance), we also have all of our project files in a Dropbox folder here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/amx3pi9egc5xjx5/AABMfUxg2s9LPHwgNt-TPY97a?dl=0

Finally, our project website is located here: 

And our video is on YouTube here: 

Thanks so much for your help, have a great break!
