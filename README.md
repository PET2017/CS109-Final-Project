# CS109-Final-Project

This folder contains all of our data files used in the project as well as our process notebook. We did not install any special Python packages in order to run our code (beyond the setup we had for CS109) so you should be able to run the notebook without any trouble. In case the github version of our notebook doesn't work for some reason (the slideshows might not render, for instance), we also have all of our project files in a Dropbox folder here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/amx3pi9egc5xjx5/AABMfUxg2s9LPHwgNt-TPY97a?dl=0

Finally, our project website is located here: 
And our video is on YouTube here: 

Thanks so much for your help, have a great break!

-Eric, Jordan, and Alex
